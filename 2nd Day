In the second module of this course, we'll explore the network layer in more depth. 
>We'll learn about the IP addressing scheme and how subnetting works. 
>We'll explore how encapsulation works and how protocols such as ARP allow different layers of the network to communicate. 
>We'll also cover the basics of routing, routing protocols, 
>and how the Internet works. By the end of this module,
>you'll be able to describe the IP addressing scheme, 
>understand how subnetting works,
>perform binary math to describe subnets,
>and understand how the Internet works.
